What is Bom vs Dom in JS?

DOM (Document Object Model):

The DOM represents the structure of HTML or XML documents as a tree-like structure where each node represents an element, attribute, or text in the document.
It provides methods and properties for accessing, modifying, and manipulating the content, structure, and style of HTML or XML documents.
The DOM allows JavaScript to dynamically update and interact with the content of web pages, enabling tasks such as adding or removing elements, changing styles, and handling events.
Example DOM methods include getElementById, querySelector, appendChild, setAttribute, etc.


BOM (Browser Object Model):

The BOM represents various objects provided by the web browser that are not directly related to the document or its structure, but rather to the browser window or environment.
It includes objects such as window, document, navigator, location, history, screen, etc.
The BOM provides methods and properties for controlling browser behavior, interacting with the user, and managing the browser window and its components.
Example BOM methods and properties include window.alert, window.open, window.close, navigator.userAgent, location.href, history.back, etc.
