        // 1. if Statement: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
        if (condition) {
        // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
        }


        // 2. if-else Statement: Executes one block of code if the specified condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.
        if (condition) {
        // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
        } else {

        }


        // 3. if-else if-else Statement: Executes different blocks of code for different conditions.
        if (condition1) {
        // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true

        // block of code to be executed if condition2 is true
        } else {
        // block of code to be executed if neither condition1 nor condition2 is true
        }


        // 4. Switch Statement: Evaluates an expression and executes different blocks of code based on different cases.
        switch (expression) {
            case value1:
        // block of code to be executed if expression is equal to value1
                break;
            case value2:
        // block of code to be executed if expression is equal to value2
                break;
             default:
        // block of code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
