<!-- WAP to convert years into days and days into years?

->  To convert years into days and vice versa, you need to know the number of days in a year and then perform the
    appropriate mathematical operations.
    Assuming a year consists of 365 days (ignoring leap years for simplicity), here's how you can write JavaScript functions
    to perform the conversions: -->

<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        // Function to convert years to days
        function yearsToDays(years) {
        return years * 365;
        }

        // Function to convert days to years
        function daysToYears(days) {
        return days / 365;
        }

        // Example usage
        let years = 2;
        let days = 730;

        console.log(years + " years is equal to " + yearsToDays(years) + " days.");
        console.log(days + " days is equal to " + daysToYears(days) + " years.");

    </script>
