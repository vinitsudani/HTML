Split the string into an array using split() Method?

Certainly! The `split()` method in JavaScript is used to split a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator. Here's how you can use it:


In this example:

- The `split(",")` method splits the string `str` at each occurrence of the comma `,`.
- The resulting array `arr` contains the substrings "Hello" and " World!".

You can specify any separator you want to split the string, including a space, a comma, a hyphen, or even a regular expression. For example:

This splits the string `str` at each occurrence of the comma `,` and creates an array with the substrings "apple", "banana", and "orange".
