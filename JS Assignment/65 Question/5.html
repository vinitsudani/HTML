<!-- What the deference between undefined and undeclare in JavaScript?

-> In JavaScript, "undefined" and "undeclared" are two distinct concepts:

    Undefined:

    "Undefined" typically refers to a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value explicitly.
    It can also be the value of an uninitialized variable or the return value of a function that doesn't explicitly return anything.
    JavaScript automatically initializes variables to undefined when they are declared but not assigned a value.
    It's a type in JavaScript, and it indicates the absence of a value or the uninitialized state of a variable.

    Undeclared:

    "Undeclared" refers to a variable that has been used without being formally declared using var, let, or const.
    Using an undeclared variable typically results in a reference error.
    This often happens when a variable is mistyped or used without proper declaration. -->
