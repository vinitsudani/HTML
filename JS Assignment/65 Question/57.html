<!-- how many type of JS Event? How to use it ?  -->

JavaScript events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser or in a web page, triggered by user interactions, browser actions, or by other means such as timers. There are many types of events in JavaScript. Here are some common ones:

1. **Mouse Events**:
   - `click`: Occurs when the user clicks on an element.
   - `mouseover`: Occurs when the mouse pointer moves over an element.
   - `mouseout`: Occurs when the mouse pointer moves out of an element.
   - `mousedown`: Occurs when the user presses a mouse button over an element.
   - `mouseup`: Occurs when the user releases a mouse button over an element.

2. **Keyboard Events**:
   - `keydown`: Occurs when a key is pressed down.
   - `keyup`: Occurs when a key is released.
   - `keypress`: Occurs when a key is pressed.

3. **Form Events**:
   - `submit`: Occurs when a form is submitted.
   - `change`: Occurs when the value of an input element changes.
   - `focus`: Occurs when an element gets focus.
   - `blur`: Occurs when an element loses focus.

4. **Window Events**:
   - `load`: Occurs when a page has finished loading.
   - `resize`: Occurs when the browser window is resized.
   - `scroll`: Occurs when the user scrolls in the window.

5. **Document Events**:

And many more...

To use JavaScript events, you typically attach event listeners to HTML elements. Here's a basic example of how you can use an event listener to detect a click event:



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <button id="myButton">Click me</button>
    <script>
// Get the button element
const button = document.getElementById("myButton");

// Attach a click event listener to the button
button.addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("Button clicked!");
});
    </script>
</body>
</html>
