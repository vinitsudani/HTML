<!-- What is the result of the expression (true && 1 && "hello")? -->

<!-- -> In JavaScript, the && operator performs a logical AND operation. It returns the first operand if it evaluates to false, otherwise, it returns the second operand.

Let's break down the expression (true && 1 && "hello"):

true evaluates to true.
1 is considered truthy.
"hello" is also considered truthy.
So, when you chain them together with &&, it returns the last truthy value, which is "hello".

Here's the JavaScript code: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        console.log(true && 1 && "hello"); // Output: "hello"
    </script>
</body>
</html>
