<!-- What is the difference between && and || in JavaScript?

-> && (Logical AND):

The && operator returns true if both operands are true.
If the first operand is false, it stops evaluating and returns the first operand. Otherwise, it returns the second
operand.
It is often used in conditional statements and expressions where both conditions need to be true for the overall
condition to be true.

-> || (Logical OR):

The || operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
If the first operand is true, it stops evaluating and returns the first operand. Otherwise, it returns the second
operand.
It is often used in conditional statements and expressions where at least one condition needs to be true for the overall
condition to be true. -->
